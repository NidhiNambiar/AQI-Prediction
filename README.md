# US AQI-Prediction

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the air quality index (AQI) in the United States using various machine learning algorithms. We employed data cleaning and manipulation techniques to preprocess the data and evaluated the results through multiple machine learning models including linear regression, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical records of air quality data across different regions in the US. It includes various features such as pollutant concentrations, weather conditions, and geographical information.

# Methods
Data Cleaning and Manipulation: We performed thorough data cleaning and manipulation to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. This step was crucial for preparing the data for machine learning modeling.
Modeling: We utilized several machine learning algorithms including linear regression, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and SVM to predict the AQI. Each model was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.
Evaluation: The performance of each model was assessed based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we conducted cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.

# Results
The results of our experiments revealed the effectiveness of certain algorithms in predicting the AQI with high accuracy. We identified the strengths and weaknesses of each model and provided insights into improving prediction accuracy.
